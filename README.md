# xlend-enso-lending

## Build and deploy program to mainnet

### Build program 

Go into Anchor.toml and add the program id mainnet below

```
[programs.mainnet]
enso_lending = "<program_id_in_mainnet>"
```

Update the path file of wallet that is authority of program and change cluster to mainnet
```
[provider]
cluster = "mainnet"
wallet = "<path_file_of_wallet>"
```

Build command
```bash
$ anchor build -- --feature mainnet
```

### Deploy

```bash
$ anchor deploy --program-name enso-lending --program-keypair /Users/minhnguyen/Documents/Working/Ensofi/xlend-smart-contract/target/deploy/enso_lending-keypair.json
```

## Trouble shooting when deploy

### 1.Insufficient fund 
```
...
Error: Account a23QvEb6Q3adWurmUVbJ9YfAa6tiEzZBdXB8cvmhViS has insufficient funds for spend...
```
This error occur because the authority wallet does not have enough fund to action the transaction, please send fund to the wallet and redeployed again

### 2.Account data to small
```
...
Error: Deploying program failed: RPC response error -32002: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: account data too small for instruction [3 log messages]
```
This error occur because the space of program deployed in onchain is less the the space that program need when deployed

Step to extends more space to deployed 

Get the current bytes of the program will deployed with this command
```bash
$ ls -l  ./target/deploy
```
Result
```
total 1544

```

Go to sol scan or solana explorer to get the current space of program
1. Navigate to the explorer, find the program by pasted program id
2. Get the id of Executable Data Account and pasted into explorer
3. Get the number in field Data Size (Bytes)

Subtract the current bytes in local with current data size had find
```
Extend addition bytes = 100 + <current_bytes_of_program_build_in_local> - <current_bytes_of_program_in_onchain>
```
Command extend program

```bash
$ solana program extend <program_id> <Addition bytes> --keypair <file_path_of_wallet>
```

And the redeployed with the command above
